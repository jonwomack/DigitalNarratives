## Source code for StoryTracker and StoryMapper.

This application is an ongoing project designed to allow people to author narratives connected to geolocated nodes in the real world.

Most narrative AR applications are anchored to objects at one location or within one environment. This means that the narrative is not told linearly across multiple locations. The concept of how a distributed narrative works across multiple locations and the poetics of narratives which rely on contextual data in the real world is a relatively unexplored concept for digital narratives. StoryTracker and StoryMapper approach narrative generation from several perspectives which relate to poetics in the form of genre and narratology as well as location-based context. 

The literary theory supporting our approach is that narratives which occur across space have a different structure than narratives tied to a singular location which usually require less context to anchor them to the real world. We believe these narrative structures most often resemble the traditional hero's journey trope, but they may contain other narrative structures and tropes. Second, because the narrative structure is anchored to specific locations it becomes difficult to ensure the content of the narrative and the reader’s location context are compatible. For example, science fiction which occurs in space may not be compatible with locations found on Earth, and fantasy narrative elements may not be compatible with a modern city. It is possible to parse narrative nodes with location context, and use machine learning to compare those nodes to a database of genre specific narratives. Then, words, phrases and sentences with local context can be transposed to a genre specific equivalent. This location-genre driven perspective on narratology allows us to isolate and address genre and location-based narrative structures independently. Given a large body of user generated location content, genre specific narratives can be generated to contextually match a dynamic narrative to multiple real world locations. 

Based on the theory above, we have created several tools which allow individuals to build a narrative across multiple locations.  Building narratives starts with creating ‘narrative nodes’ - parts of stories that are tagged with geolocations and later processed for contextual and metadata structures. These user constructed narrative nodes are uploaded and browsable from an online database.  In addition to being a tool for telling stories located in space, this database of narrative nodes is a repository of prototypical location-based narratives.  These ‘prototypes’ provide contextual meaning based on location as well as story arc examples designed to be experienced over multiple locations. This user generated narrative tool is called StoryTracker.  Once narratives exist in the StoryTracker database for a given set of locations, they provide a sandbox of story elements tied to their respective locations. From these elements we can parse for poetic structure, local contextual data, and syntactic structures; each of these provides information for remapping one sentence to another.  The second tool uses context from individual story nodes and generates a genre specific narrative, both of which are dependent on the user’s current location. We call this part of the toolset StoryMapper.
